Assume we are traversing the input string from left to right, say initially we are at 0th position. If instead of 'A' suppose B was present, then all the strings which would start with A would come first than B, right? Thus, the number of strings which come before BC would No_strings which start with A + No_strings which start with B before BC. But luckily we have initial letter as A. Now the 1st character is 'C' , thus we need to count all the strings which start with AB. If instead of 'C' there was a D, then we would have to count the number of strings starting with AB, AC.

    " P is divisor of Q, if dividing Q by P does not leave any remainder. A number, N, is called a perfect number, if the sum of all such divisors of N(not including N) is equal to N. 6 is the smallest perfect number. It's factors are 1,2,3 and their sum is 1+2+3=6. So, to check whether a number, say N, is perfect or not, it is required to find all the divisors of that number. The easiest way to do this is to check every number form 2 to N-1 if it is dividing N completely or not, and take the sum of all the divisor. While this may work well for small numbers, it would be very time consuming for large numbers.\n",

Similarly, all numbers between N/2 and N/3 cannot be divisors of N, and so on. So, at each step we can check two numbers to be divisors of N and at the same time we can eliminate a fraction of the numbers less than N as not divisors and putting an upper bound on the next biggest possible divisor. Lets apply this tactic to find the divisors of 60.\n",

Thus we shall choose q as step(A/B) and E as 1/frac(A/B). Now we shall see programatically how can we represent and E as we need to do the same operation on E. Obviosuly from the above equation E = B/(A-B*q) which means E is also a fraction. Thus we express E in terms of some (x,y) where x = B and y = A-B*q and do the same operation as we have done on (A,B).
